# Platformer Character/Controller 2D for Godot

A 2d platformer character controller for godot. Inpired by [this tutorial by TaroDev](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sWTzMsmdx8)

## Usage

Simply copy the code from `platformer_character_2d` and paste it into your project. I have thought of making this into a plugin. But ultimately decided that having it as just a script that people can just edit is better.

## Features

- Variable jump height
- Apex Modifiers / Hang Time
- Jump Buffering
- Coyote Time
- Clamped Fall speed
